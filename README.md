Orchids, known for their ornamental appeal, are frequently cultivated, with each genus requiring specific growing methods. Beginner cultivators should understand the characteristics of the orchid genus they intend to grow. However, many novices lack the necessary knowledge and experience, leading to suboptimal orchid growth and flowering. This study created a system to classify orchid genus images, specifically for Cattleya, Dendrobium, Oncidium, Phalaenopsis, and Vanda. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method was used for image classification, processing orchid images based on their genus. The classification involves training and testing phases: the training phase develops a CNN model and adjusts weights, while the testing phase applies the model to new image data. K-Fold Cross Validation was utilized during training, and a Confusion Matrix was used to evaluate the CNN model after testing.
